	- Restaurant List Page:

		1. Maybe use a titleView for the navigation bar instead of a simple title text.
		2. Push to detail view controller when tapped on cells.
		3. Add restaurant list section headers (just a simple lightGray line with "featured" and "more" in its center.)
		4. Add an activity indicator while loading data from server.
		5. Disable map and layout bar buttons while loading data from server.
		6. [Not Applicable] Maybe add an activity indicator while tapped on map bar button.
        7. [Added] Add pull-to-refresh control.
            - on app launching, programmatically trigger refreshing.
            - add background image to UICollectionView
            - if data fetch failed, show relevant message to let user refresh again
            - disable all bar buttons until data fetched completely and successfully
        8. Determine hight of each detailed cell dynamically by its content length.
        9. [Added] Add highlight color for RestaurantCollectonViewCell.
		10. Polish UI.
        11. Add open/closed tag for table view cell only.
        12. Add "sort by name/opening hour/closing hour/opening now/with/without menu."
        13. [Nice to have] Add a search bar like in eBay app.


	- MapThem! Page:

		1. Push to detail view controller when tapped on info windows.
		2. Orient map according to current heading data (OPTIONAL)
			Bearing (orientation)

			The direction in which a vertical line on the map points, measured in degrees clockwise from north. Someone driving a car often turns a road map to align it with their direction of travel, while hikers using a map and compass usually orient the map so that a vertical line is pointing north. The Google Maps SDK for iOS lets you change a map's alignment or bearing. For example, a bearing of 90 degrees results in a map where the upwards direction points due east.

			Users are able to change the bearing by using a two-finger gesture to rotate the orientation of the map. You can set the bearing programmatically with animateToBearing: on GMSMapView.

			[mapView_ animateToBearing:0];

    - Detail Page:

        1. Add favorite button
        2. use UIPageViewController to scroll among days of the week
        3. show dishes of the day(if there are), opening/closing hour of the day, Google Map for location(not in UIPageViewController), and other information.

    - Overall:

        1. Try RestKit (make use of its CoreData)
        2.

GLITCHES:
=========

	- Restaurant List Page:

		1. [Investigated]Scrolling is choppy on iPhone 4 with iOS 7.0.3
            -- because there are too much overhead for drawing views on each cell (UIImageView is not the major reason.)
		2. Google Map page loading is slow on first load. (approx. 2 seconds for iPhone 4 and 1 second for iPhone 5S)
		3. Placeholder images are abrupt.
		4. View is for now scrolled to top on purpose in order to avoid ugly animation.
			Maybe try asynced collectionView:layout:scrolltoitematindexpath: with custom animation duration for the first item in collectionView.visibleCells.
